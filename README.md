## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This project covers the main learning outcomes required for a simple 2D game development assignment:

- **Canvas API** – Drawing, animation, ground, player, clouds, obstacles.
- **Data structures** – Arrays for obstacles & clouds, objects for player.
- **Algorithms** – Collision detection, gravity, jumping, sine-wave motion, procedural obstacle generation.
- **Functions** – All logic broken into clean, reusable functions.
- **Git Version Control** – Use of Git properly.
- **Game Documentation** – Includes GDD (Game Design Document) and Testing notes.
- **Debugging Techniques** – Console logs, bounding box checks.
- **LocalStorage** – Automatically saves high score.
